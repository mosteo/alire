- Don't artificially keep a removed dependency
- Implement `alr with` with transparent fallback
  - Rather than fully transparent, inform if the addition requires a full resolving
- Test that an old dependency version is preserved
- Test that when impossible without upgrade, this is reported
- Test that when a dep is removed, it is not kept artificially in the solution
- Test that changing (not removing/adding) a dependency doesn't try to preserve the old release (as it may be impossible to fulfill) and that dependency is freely updatable
- Test that indirect dependencies are not considered direct for some reason
- See why fixing a conflict doesnt show "hello" as a new crate in the solution when it was missing in the incomplete solution.
- Test that `alr with` doesn't touch other dependencies
